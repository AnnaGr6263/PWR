                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p>My IT interests focus on algorithms, data analysis, and the applications of mathematics in computer science. I am passionate about programming in C++ and Java, designing and managing databases, and exploring computer architecture and operating systems. I believe that understanding the low-level mechanisms of hardware and software is key to creating optimal solutions. I continuously develop my skills to meet the challenges of modern technology.</p>

                <h3>Tennis and Travel</h3>
                <p>Besides programming, I love playing tennis. It is a sport that not only keeps me in good physical shape but also teaches discipline, strategic thinking, and perseverance. In my free time, I enjoy picking up a racket to play a match with friends or just to practice.</p>
                <p>One of my greatest passions is also traveling. My favorite trip was to Madeira – the island of eternal spring. I was captivated by the picturesque landscapes, mountain trails, exotic vegetation, and the extraordinary hospitality of the locals. It was an unforgettable adventure that will remain in my memory for a long time. Here are some photos from my travels:</p>
